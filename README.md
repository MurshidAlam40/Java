# Java
Always focus on the logic-building of the problems.. 
# Some tips before writing code:

Use a pen and paper to work out solutions.

The logic / algorithm first has to be clear in your mind before you decide to code it out.

Don't spend more than 30 minutes on any problem. While the objective is to learn - if you don't know the approach, it's best to learn the concept / review the solution.

For Beginner's level programming problems - we think the following works best
# Some Important Steps in Problem Solving
Step 1: Understand the problem statement and the sample test cases.

Step 2: Generate examples - Create 10 input and output cases of your own.

Step 3: Observations / Pattern - Observe your examples to identify the logic.

Step 4: Plan your code - Modularise and solve sub-components of your problem.

Step 5: Learn - You may come across components of you logic where you don't know how to execute the code.

In such cases, ask Google or ChatGPT or your friends and learn!

Step 6: Write the code - For simpler programming problems - Java solutions will be less than 20 lines in more than 95% of the cases.

Step 7: Identify edge cases - If your code still fails - try and and come up with corner cases where your code may fail
